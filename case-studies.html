        <h2>1. The Wi-Fi Toggle Switch (Binary Choice Widget)</h2>
        <p>
          This case study examines a simple interaction on a modern mobile
          device (e.g., iPhone or Samsung) using parallel models to understand
          user intent and system response.
        </p>

        <h3>Norman's Action Cycle Analysis:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Goal:</strong> The user recognizes a need for internet
            access: "I need Wi-Fi ON".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan:</strong> A mental simulation occurs where the user
            decides to use a specific method, such as the "quick toggle" menu
            for efficiency rather than going through deep system settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Specify:</strong> The user performs a visual search to
            locate the fan-shaped Wi-Fi icon among other toggles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Execute:</strong> The physical motor action takes place; for
            example, a finger taps the toggle on a touchscreen (a process
            roughly estimated at 0.2 seconds).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Perceive & Interpret:</strong> The user sees the switch move
            and the color change from grey to blue, interpreted as "Wi-Fi is now
            ON".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluate:</strong> The user verifies the outcome by looking
            for the Wi-Fi icon in the status bar or attempting to load a
            webpage.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>GOMS & KLM Interpretation:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Goal/Method:</strong> The top-level objective is
            "Enable-Wi-Fi". The GOMS "Method" corresponds to Norman's "Plan"
            (e.g., Swipe down → Control Center → Wi-Fi).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operators (KLM):</strong> GOMS abstracts the cognitive
            "Specify" stage, focusing on the timed motor execution. The KLM
            sequence is modeled as <strong>[M]</strong> (Mental preparation,
            ~1.35s), <strong>[P]</strong> (Pointing to the icon, ~1.1s), and
            <strong>[K]</strong> or <strong>[B]</strong> (Keystroke or Button
            tap, ~0.2s).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Divergence:</strong> Norman's model focuses on closing the
            <strong>Gulf of Evaluation</strong> (Perceive/Interpret/Evaluate),
            which is entirely outside the scope of GOMS, as GOMS assumes perfect
            perception and instant goal satisfaction.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. The Automatic Syringe (Dose Calculator)</h2>
        <p>
          This case study highlights the difference between a "recall-heavy"
          interface and one designed for "recognition," focusing on
          safety-critical errors.
        </p>

        <h3>Bad Design (Numeric Keypad):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Analysis:</strong> The user must enter doses via a numeric
            keypad. This forces an extra abstraction layer: Clinical intent →
            Abstract numeric encoding → Motor execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gulf of Execution:</strong> The user must
            <strong>recall</strong> the exact digit sequence (e.g.,
            "0-1-2-.-5-0" for 12.5 ml/hr). This heavy memory load leads to a
            wide Gulf of Execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gulf of Evaluation:</strong> If the display shows only
            "1250," it is ambiguous; the user must mentally convert the number
            to determine if it means 12.5 or 125.0, resulting in a wide Gulf of
            Evaluation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consequence:</strong> A single key slip (a "slip" in
            execution) can cause a <strong>10x overdose</strong> (e.g., setting
            1372 instead of 137).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Good Design (Individual Digit Buttons):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Analysis:</strong> The redesigned interface uses individual
            increment/decrement buttons for each digit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Norman's Stages:</strong> The "Plan" shifts from recall to
            <strong>visual adjustment (recognition)</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Specify/Execute:</strong> The user specifies the action by
            pressing larger, error-resistant buttons for specific units (Tens,
            Units, Tenths), reducing motor complexity and following
            <strong>Fitts's Law</strong> more effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Perceive/Evaluate:</strong> The display clearly shows "12.50
            ml" with units, providing a direct visual mapping that narrows the
            Gulf of Evaluation and increases confidence in accuracy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. The "Who Paid?" Problem (Splitwise Analysis)</h2>
        <p>
          This study treats an interaction as a
          <strong>social coordination system</strong> where design decisions
          have emotional and social consequences.
        </p>

        <h3>Norman's Action Cycle Analysis:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Goal:</strong> A complex intent involving
            <strong>social fairness</strong>: "Record that Maria paid 5000 PKR
            so everyone pays fairly".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan & Specify:</strong> The user must mentally plan
            multiple steps: open the app, enter a description, and select the
            payer and participants. This involves a
            <strong>high cognitive load</strong> because the user must recall
            who ordered what and individual prices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Execute:</strong> The physical actions—typing, selecting,
            and checking—often interrupt social conversation at a dinner table.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Perceive & Interpret:</strong> The interface must provide
            multiple feedback channels (e.g., green checkmark animation,
            "Expense added!" text, and notification sounds sent to others).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluate:</strong> The user verifies the action by checking
            the group history and confirming that others have acknowledged
            receipt.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Social and Cognitive Challenges:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Trust:</strong> Evaluation is not just about data
            entry; it is about <strong>social trust</strong> (e.g., "Did
            everyone get notified?") to avoid arguments about money among
            friends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Discomfort:</strong> Explicit monetary calculations
            in groups can increase "calculating" behavior, causing social
            awkwardness or the fear of being seen as "cheap".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Outcome Visibility:</strong> Ambiguity in outcome visibility
            (not knowing immediately who owes what) leads to manual reasoning
            and potential disputes.
          </li>
        </ul>
